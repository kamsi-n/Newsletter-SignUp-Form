## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to better manage overflows on the page, espcially in mobile view. I learned how to properly calculate element sizes to prevent layout shifts. I also learned how to use the active state for styles that are not visible on the screen.

### Continued development

I'm still learning validation and form submission. I'm also still trying to figure out how to make the form look good on mobile.

### Useful resources
